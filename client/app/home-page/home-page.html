                <h3>Tambola / Housie</h3>
                <p>
                    As a rule, each player must buy at least one ticket to enter a game. A typical 90 ball Tambola
                    ticket consists of 3 rows and 9 columns which make 27 spaces. Each row has a total of 5 numbers
                    printed on it. A column can have 1, 2 or the maximum 3 numbers printed on it. The first column in
                    the ticket will have numbers from 1-9, the second column will have 10-19, third column with 20-29
                    and so on until the 9th column which will be numbered in between 80-90
                </p>

                <br/>
                <br/>

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    The game begins with a ball draw. As the game progresses, the board is marked with each ball that is
                    drawn. The objective of the game is to mark/ dab all the numbers found in the ticket as called by
                    the dealer. The player who first mark all the numbers in a winning pattern and calls a win is
                    declared as the WINNER of that pattern after the dealer checks his ticket and verify it with numbers
                    drawn.

                    If your claimed winning pattern is wrong, it will be called BOOGY and you cannot continue the game
                    with the same ticket.

                    The game ends when all 90 numbers are drawn, or when a winner is declared for all the patterns of
                    the game, whichever comes first.
                </p>
